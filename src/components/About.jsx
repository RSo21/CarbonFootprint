                     <p>Today, the term “carbon footprint” is often used as shorthand for the amount of carbon 
                        (usually in tonnes) being emitted by an activity or organization. The carbon footprint 
                        is also an important component of the Ecological Footprint, since it is one competing demand 
                        for biologically productive space. Carbon emissions from burning fossil fuel accumulate in the 
                        atmosphere if there is not enough biocapacity dedicated to absorb these emissions. Therefore, 
                        when the carbon footprint is reported within the context of the total Ecological Footprint, 
                        the tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions are expressed as the amount of productive land area required 
                        to sequester those carbon dioxide emissions. This tells us how much biocapacity is necessary to 
                        neutralize the emissions from burning fossil fuels.</p>
